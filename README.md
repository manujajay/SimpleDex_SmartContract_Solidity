# SimpleDEX: Decentralized Exchange

SimpleDEX is a blockchain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing users to swap ERC-20 tokens in a trustless and decentralized manner. This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as a basic prototype for a DEX on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Token Swapping**: Swap between two ERC-20 tokens.
- **Liquidity Provision**: (Future feature) Users can provide liquidity to the exchange.
- **Liquidity Withdrawal**: (Future feature) Users can withdraw their liquidity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) - Development framework for Ethereum
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) - Personal blockchain for Ethereum development

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manujajay/SimpleDex_SmartContract_Solidity.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Navigate to your project directory and install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile the contracts**

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

4. **Start Ganache**

   Launch Ganache for a local Ethereum blockchain.

5. **Migrate the contracts**

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```

6. **Testing**

   Run the test suite to verify that everything is set up correctly:

   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```

## Usage

Explain how to use the DEX for swapping tokens.

### Swapping Tokens

- Provide instructions or scripts for token swapping.

### Providing Liquidity

- Explain how liquidity can be provided (in future implementations).

### Withdrawing Liquidity

- Guidelines for withdrawing liquidity (in future implementations).

## Built With

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - The programming language for Ethereum smart contracts
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) - Ethereum development framework
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) - Personal blockchain for Ethereum development
